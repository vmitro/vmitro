- Hi, I’m @vmitro and momentarilly would like to remain Anonymous
- I’m interested in computers, programming, systems design, machine learning, deep learning, AI stuff, Python, Kotlin, C, Android development
- I’m currently learning how to bash characters into a text editor until the source file successfully compiles.
- How to reach me: I don't have many, if any, social networks, hang out here quite often. HMU for anything.
